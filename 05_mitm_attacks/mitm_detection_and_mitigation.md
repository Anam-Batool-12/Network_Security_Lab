# MITM Detection & Mitigation

## Detection Indicators
- Frequent ARP table changes
- Duplicate MAC addresses
- Abnormal ARP reply frequency
- TLS certificate warnings

## SOC Tools
- IDS/IPS alerts
- ARP monitoring
- NetFlow analysis
- Endpoint security agents

## Mitigation Techniques
- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)
- Static ARP entries for critical hosts
- Network segmentation
- Encrypted protocols

## Why This Matters
Understanding attacker techniques improves defensive visibility and response time.
