# MITM Attacks & Traffic Analysis (Lab Project)

## Objective
This project demonstrates a controlled Man‑in‑the‑Middle (MITM) attack in an isolated lab environment.
The goal is to understand:
- How traffic can be intercepted at Layer 2
- What information is exposed even with HTTPS
- How SOC teams detect and mitigate MITM attacks

## Scope
- ARP spoofing–based MITM
- Traffic capture and analysis
- DNS spoofing (lab‑only)
- Detection and defensive controls

## Environment
- Attacker: Kali Linux
- Victim: Isolated lab host
- Network: Private virtual network
- Tools: arpspoof, Ettercap, Bettercap, tcpdump, Wireshark

⚠️ All testing was performed in a controlled lab environment only.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Network traffic interception
- Protocol analysis (ARP, DNS, TCP, HTTP, TLS)
- MITM detection techniques
- Security documentation and sanitization
